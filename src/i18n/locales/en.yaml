  Pushover bot uses the <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover service</a> to deliver notifications from Telegram to your device.

  You can add the bot to a group, and every member of that group will be able to send notifications to your smartphone.
  For example, to wake you up if the BTC price reaches new highs.

  <b>Available commands in group chat:</b>
  /gm — Send notification to all group members
  /gm text — Send custom text to all
  /gm @username — Send to a specific member by username
  /gm @username text — With custom text
  /gm user_id — Send to a specific member by ID
  /gm user_id text — By ID with custom text
  /enable — Start receiving notifications from this group.
  /disable — Stop receiving notifications from this group.
  /test_alarm — Send a test notification to yourself.
  /help — Show this informative message.
  /only_admin — Allow or disallow non-admin chat members to use the /gm command.

  <b>Available commands in private chat with the bot:</b>
  /key — Configure Pushover API key.
  /list — List of groups with enabled notifications.
  /test_alarm — Send a test notification to yourself.
  /language — Change language.
  /help — Show this informative message.

  To start receiving notifications in a group, each member who wants to receive notifications must use the /enable command inside the desired group.

  Before that, you need to configure your Pushover API key using the /key command in private messages with the bot.
