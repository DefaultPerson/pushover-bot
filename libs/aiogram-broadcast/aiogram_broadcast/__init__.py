"""
aiogram-broadcast - Broadcast/newsletter library for aiogram 3.x

A pluggable library for managing subscribers and broadcasting messages
in Telegram bots built with aiogram.

Features:
- Automatic subscriber registration via middleware
- Rate-limited broadcasting to avoid API limits
- Scheduled broadcasts with APScheduler integration
- Redis storage for subscribers
- Progress callbacks for monitoring broadcasts
- Interactive UI menu for creating broadcasts (see aiogram_broadcast.ui)

Quick Start:
    from aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher
    from redis.asyncio import Redis
    from aiogram_broadcast import (
        BroadcastMiddleware,
        BroadcastService,
        RedisBroadcastStorage,
    )

    # Setup
    redis = Redis()
    storage = RedisBroadcastStorage(redis)
    bot = Bot(token="YOUR_TOKEN")
    dp = Dispatcher()

    # Register middleware
    dp.update.outer_middleware.register(BroadcastMiddleware(storage))

    # Create service
    broadcast = BroadcastService(bot, storage)

    # Broadcast to all subscribers
    result = await broadcast.broadcast_text("Hello everyone!")
    print(f"Sent to {result.successful}/{result.total} users")

Interactive UI:
    For a complete interactive menu, see the `aiogram_broadcast.ui` module:

    from aiogram_broadcast.ui import (
        BroadcastUIMiddleware,
        BroadcastUIHandlers,
        BroadcastUIManager,
